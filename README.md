## This course is the capstone course for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate. 
### Apps govern our daily lives, with everything from tracking our diets to games. So we set off with a Kaggle data set from 2018 analysing the meta data of the app store apps at that time, in hopes to gain a better understanding of the types of popular apps on the app store. 
In essence, what principle properties govern a successful app, what types of apps are most popular?  What are some properties in apps reviews that can help us understand more successful apps.  

### From developers to business experts to artists, we hope this analysis will help guide decisions in developing future apps and technologies. By determining various properties of successful apps that users like and respond to well. This information will be useful to understanding how to engineer future technologies that require app like interfaces.
